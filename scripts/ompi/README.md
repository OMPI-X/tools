 - NOTE: This is a modified version of OMPIX build script for OpenMPI
    to build **just** OMPI.  It uses tarballs, but the code for using
    git repos is commented out.  The other bits were removed to make it
    simpler for the "just OMPI" case.

    See the 'scripts/ompix/' subdir for more elaborate/complete version.
